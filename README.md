I originally started writing this node.js API for a product I'm building.

I was interested in writing the API with express.js because I've heard good things.

I learned a lot about ES6 JavaScript features, and the node.js development environment.

I can see why people use Node for backend development. Using the same language for backend development and frontend development is what made it most appealing to me. JavaScript also has a massive community behind it, there are a lot of libraries and documentation.

If I had originally started web development as a frontend developer, I think I would have been 100% OK with building node backend APIs, maybe even happy.

But coming from Rails, there are a few things that made me unhappy.

1. I enjoy Ruby's simple syntax.
2. The debugging process: it was kinda cool to debug through the browser and set breakpoints. But I prefer placing binding.pry in my code and hitting breakpoints in the terminal.
3. Async and await make promises/callbacks more fun to work with. But it was annoying to have to worry about event driven code in a backend language.
4. Sequelize is pretty good, but ActiveRecord is just better.
5. Not a fair comparison, but Rails just has the structure and nice to have features that you don't have to implement in express.js.

I'd probably consider building basic APIs in express but for bigger projects I think I'll stick with Rails.
